## Let's talk about

# Software Architecture

## ἀρχι - arkhi - "chief"
## τέκτων - tekhton - "builder"

## Architecture is thinking about the way that we build things

---
class: middle, center

# We have tons of options

---

# Components

# What is API-first?

## <strike>Product, then API</strike>

## API, then product

### (or at the same time)

---
class: middle, center

# API-first

### I'm going to have an API.
### I need to make it good.
### Promotes better architecture.

---
class: middle, center

# I'm going to have an API.

# Additonal Product?

## Additional revenue stream

# Your users are creative

## Enable them

---

# APIs and competition

### Why re-build the basics when you can build on top?

---
class: middle, center

# I'm going to have an API.

## It's easier to start with this assumption

---
class: middle, center

# I'm going to have an API.

## Design is all about tradeoffs. Knowing your assumptions helps.

# I need to make it good.

# Promotes better architecture.

---

# API-first clearly separates your concerns

---
class: middle, center

# Separate concerns?
# Separate codebases

<hr/>

### Separate codebases?
### Separate teams?

---
class: middle, center

## Many small components are easier to understand than one huge one.

---
class: middle, center

# Better architecture

## Design is all about tradeoffs. Knowing your assumptions helps.

### So many other tools

### HAL, Collecton+JSON, Siren

# API First + SPA

## Single page apps make this even nicer
